HOW TO RUN THE CODE 

Enter the image name in the main file. these image should be in the test_images folder.
use out.p model.
RUN- python3 main.py

check settings.py file to change the parametes of the hog featurs before training.

ABOUT THE FILES
bulit_data.py
This file collects all the images of cars and non cars and saves it as an np.array.

trian.py
this file is used to train the model. To change the features selection and parameters open setting.py
This file reades data from the built_data.py and trains the model.

main.py
this is the main file. This file runs on the image which are in the test_images folder , user has to specify the name of the image present in the folder.

window.py
This file contains all the sliding window and the non maximal supression function.

features.py
This file contains functions used to extract hog features,spacial features, colour histogram .

setting.py
This file contains all the parameters of the the features and also give option to choose features. 

All the images require different sizes of bounding boxes. User can change the bounding box size in the main.py file --  xy_window(width,height),
xy_overlap(s direction,y direction) -> this shifts the sliding window  ,x tell how much to overlap with the previos window in x direction and y tells in y direction. 

Bounding box size has to be changed to get best results.
orientaion ,pixel_percell,cell_per_block can be changed while training with to get different results on different images.

out.p is made using hog,spacial features and colour of histogram features.  chage the following parameters in setting.py wile using out.py
spatial_feat = true ,hist_feat = True ,hog_feat = True in settings.py
